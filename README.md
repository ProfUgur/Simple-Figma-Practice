# Simple-Figma-Practice

Hello, here you can see the visual design work of a simple mobile application requested from me by one of my teachers. 
(NOTE: The free version of Figma was used when designing this application. In conclusion, there is no advanced functionality for the pages.)

The demands made from us were as follows:
- The application belongs to a cookie company
- There are four different types of cookies (chocolate, hazelnut, apple and flour cookies)
- There is no logo of the company
- There is no slogan of the company
- The application should be simple and consist of a few pages
- Color and design preferences are entirely up to me

I put a few images of the application here.

I leave here the presentation link of the application I designed in accordance with the demands. If you click on the "Fit to Screen" button using the "Options" at the top right of the page that opens, you can get the appropriate size view. Thanks.
